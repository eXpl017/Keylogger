# Keylogger
A simple keylogger in python

This keylogger written in python logs the keys pressed by the victim and sends a report via email to the attacker on the specified email.

###### FOLLOW THE STEPS TO MAKE THE CODE WORK ######

1. As the feature of "Less Secure Apps" has been disabled by google, we can use the email-if and password directly.
2. The email-id provided to send the mails must have 2FA on.
3. After this, one needs to get the APP password from their account. This option can be found in the Security section of Manage Account.
4. Select app=Other which asks for an app and device which is then allowed for the use of the email.
5. Clicking generate will generate the password and this is the one which has to be used for making the code work, otherwise you will get
   an authentication error.
